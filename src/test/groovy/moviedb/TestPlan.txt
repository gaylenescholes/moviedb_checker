TheMovieDB website has a set of documents describing its functionality.
Included in this is the page: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/search-and-query-for-details
This page will be the basis for the test plan and cases for this exercise.

Individual test cases are either pseudo-coded in the appropriate class, or have been coded in place.
Spock (a BDD language in Groovy) was used for the test cases.

Areas for testing:
1. Json : JsonFormatTest.groovy
    - the formatted response should have all the correct fields.

2. Correct Data : SearchAndQuerySpec.groovy
    - Expected data is returned for specific calls to the API
    - Filters work according to specification
    - Endpoints described in the document are working

3. Expected Exceptions and Error Conditions : ExceptionSpec.groovy
    - Exceptions should be thrown for error input
    - Status codes for error conditions and relevant information are sent
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes 4xx series
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes 5xx series

4. Standard HTTP actions : HttpCallSpec.groovy
    - Not all Http calls should be considered valid.
    - Verify only the allowed Http methods return a json response
    - These are also security tests.

5. Authorization and other Preconditions : AuthorizationSpec.groovy
    - Verify the target site is operational
    - Verify the key entered is valid
    - Verify an invalid key results in an error response

6. Performance and Scalability : Noted for completeness
    - These tests are NOT included.
    - JMeter is generally used for this type of testing. Although baseline could be determined, because there
    are no requirements for expected results on the descriptive page selected, the tests were not written for
    this exercise.

7. Manual testing:
    - Additional tests and exploration of the API can be achieved by using a favorite application
    - POSTMAN add-on to Chrome and the native app for windows and iOS can be used for building endpoint evaluations
    - JMeter can be used for "ility" testing
